You shower me with words. Made of knives. Whenever you look at me. I wish I was her. These days when I see you. You make it look. Like see-through. Do tell me why. You waste our time. When your heart. Ain't admitting. You're not satisfied. You know I know. Just how you feel. I'm starting to find myself. Feeling that way too. (Chorus). Time and time again. I play the role of fool.
